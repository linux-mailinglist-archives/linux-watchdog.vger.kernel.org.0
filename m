Philippe did receive that Reviewed-by. I gave it to him.
Doing his first public patches, he first requested a review off-list to
try to get things right and not bother people too much (so much for that :/)

He did not.

No worries. That being said, I have gone over 

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst

It just says that Reviewed-by sent on the list should be collected for
the following version. Nothing against adding the tag if the job has
been done, on or off list. Same goes for Suggested-by, Tested-by, etc.

If I missed something or it is non-written rule, please let me know.

I do want Philippe to add it. I would not have given it the first place
if it was not the case.
