I initially started developing MAX77714 watchdog support as an addition
to max77620_wdt.c as the procedures look identical at least for the
basic features.

But the register content seems completely different. Here are the notes
I took at that time:

-------------------------8<-------------------------

MAX77620 has reg ONOFFCNFG1  at 0x41, ONOFFCNFG2  at 0x42.
MAX77714 has reg CNFG1_ONOFF at 0x93, CNFG2_ONOFF at 0x94.
OK, we can handle this with a register indirection table, indexed by
chip model.

MAX77620 has MAX77620_REG_FPS_CFG0 register.
On MAX77714 I was unable to find any such register (I haven't looked at
FPS in detail though).
OK, we can handle this with some if()s or entirely disable PM on the
77714 until anybody cares.

MAX77620 ONOFFCNFG1  has SFT_RST in bit 7.
MAX77714 CNFG1_ONOFF has SFT_RST is bit 6.
Uhm, should we have a _bit_ indirection table in addition to the
_register_ indirection table?

MAX77620 ONOFFCNFG2  bit 5 is SLP_LPM_MSK, involved in FPS.
MAX77620 ONOFFCNFG2  bit 6 is WD_RTS_WK, configures the watchdog timer.
MAX77714 CNFG2_ONOFF bit 5 is WD_RTS_WK, configures the watchdog timer.
On MAX77714 I haven't found SLP_LPM_MSK.

MAX77620 has 6 CID registers with "ES version" in CID5.
MAX77714 has 5 CID registers with "DEVICE id" in CID3.
CID registers would be useful to get the chip model directly from the
chip, if only they had the same structure.

Almost all of the registers I have been looking into have similar
differences.

-------------------------8<-------------------------

When I started adding indirection tables the driver started growing
bigger and uglier, and that little simple driver started being big and
complex. So I opted to add a new driver.

Let me know whether that sounds OK.
