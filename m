From I have just learned from Krzysztof Kozlowski those headers shouldn't
even exist in first place, as the listed IDs are not actually referenced
anywhere in the driver, hence they aren't actually bindings [1].

Quote from that thread:

Now that they do exist it's too late to change that for everything
already existing, I suppose. However, it also doesn't seem like adding
such a header for MT7988 as well is going to be acknowledged, hence we
will have to live with the inconsistency in the driver in which older
SoCs will obtain the number of resets from a macro in their respective
dt-bindings header while newer SoCs won't have such header and hence
it will have to be defined in the driver itself (as that's also the
only place where that number is being used).

Ack. Will do.
