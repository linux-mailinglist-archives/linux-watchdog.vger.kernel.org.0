Okay, I will split the patches that are still under review into the
above patch series.

But I have a dumb question, currently, we have some patches that have
been assigned version numbers.
If I want to seprate original patch series, and resend 3 new patch
series (basic / pinctrl / clock) according to your comment, if I want
to keep the preview change log, tags in the patch set: 

like:
---
v3: changed 'MT7986' to 'MT7986 series' in the commit message
v2: added an Acked-by tag
---

Which version number should I use for these new patch series ?

Does the version number in corver-letter and the version number in each
patch need to be the same in the entire patch series ?

// (Original patch series/thread, version number is v3)
[PATCH v3 0/3] Add basic SoC support for mediatek mt7986
  [PATCH v3 1/3] dt-bindings: arm64: dts: mediatek: Add mt7986 series
  // (the version number has been updated to v5 previously)
  // (basic part only, not include pinctrl and clock nodes)
  [PATCH v5 2/3] arm64: dts: mediatek: add mt7986a support
  [PATCH v5 3/3] arm64: dts: mediatek: add mt7986b support

// (New clock driver patch series)
[PATCH 0/3] Add clock driver support for mediatek mt7986
  [PATCH v3,1/3] dt-bindings: clock: mediatek: document clk bindings   
for mediatek mt7986 SoC
  // (the version number has been updated to v3 previously)
  [PATCH v3 2/3] clk: mediatek: add mt7986 clock IDs
  [PATCH v2 3/3] clk: mediatek: add mt7986 clock support

// (New pinctrl driver patch series)
[PATCH 0/4] Add pinctrl driver support for mediatek mt7986
  // (the version number has been updated to v6 previously)
  [PATCH v6 1/4] dt-bindings: pinctrl: update bindings for MT7986 SoC
  // (the version number has been updated to v2 previously)
  [PATCH v2 2/4] pinctrl: mediatek: add support for MT7986 SoC
  [PATCH 3/4] arm64: dts: mediatek: add mt7986a pinctrl support
  [PATCH 3/4] arm64: dts: mediatek: add mt7986b pinctrl support

If I don't respond to the next patch set in the same thread, should I
create an entire new patch series ?

For example, if I want to update PATCH 2/3 in the bellows patch series,
and my PATCH 1/3 has been accepted by reviewer previously

[PATCH v2 0/3] Add basic SoC support for mediatek mt7986
  [PATCH v2 1/3] ...   (patch set v1, applied by matainer)
  [PATCH v2 2/3] ...   (patch set v2, need to be upgrade to v3)
  [PATCH v2 3/3] ...   (patch set v1, waiting for review)

Is this correct to send patch mail to maintaiers for the above
situation ?

[PATCH v3 0/2] Add basic SoC support for mediatek mt7986
  [PATCH v3 1/2] ...   (patch set v3)
  [PATCH v3 2/2] ...   (still patch set v1, waiting for review)
