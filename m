BTW, you can use "wdat_wdt.dyndbg" to debug this. It should log all the
instructions it runs.

I think you are right. For the code in acpi_watchdog.c:

	if (gas->space_id == ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_MEMORY) {
		res.flags = IORESOURCE_MEM;
		res.end = res.start + ALIGN(gas->access_width, 4) - 1;
	} else if (gas->space_id == ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_IO) {
		res.flags = IORESOURCE_IO;
		res.end = res.start + gas->access_width - 1;
	} else {
		..

I think it does the "correct" thing, although it is bit convoluted. The
first one aligns it to 4 and the I/O access is either 8- or 16-bits so
it should be fine, unless I'm missing something.

However, this code in wdat_wdt.c:

                 r.end = r.start + gas->access_width - 1;

is not correct. In this case, I don't think it affects anything but
should still be fixed.

Yes, I agree. It seems that we also have helper macro for this:
ACPI_ACCESS_BIT_WIDTH() that can be used as well but the result needs to
be divided by 8.

I will make a patch that fixes these later this week (quite busy with
something else right now), unless you want to do that.
