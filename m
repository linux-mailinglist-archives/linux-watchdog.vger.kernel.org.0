Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] Add managed version of delayed work init

It's not rare that device drivers need delayed work.
It's not rare that this work needs driver's data.

Often this means that driver must ensure the work is not queued when
driver is detached. Often it is done by ensuring new work is not added and
then calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() at remove(). In many cases this
may also require cleanup at probe error path - which is easy to forget.

Also the "by ensuring new work is not added" has a gotcha.

It is not strange to see devm managed IRQs scheduling (delayed) work.
Mixing this with manua wq clean-up is hard to do correctly because the
devm is likely to free the IRQ only after the remove() is ran. So manual
wq cancellation and devm-based IRQ management do not mix well - there is
a short(?) time-window after the wq clean-up when IRQs are still not
freed and may schedule new work.

When both WQs and IRQs are managed by devm things are likely to just
work. WQs should be initialized before IRQs (when IRQs need to schedule
work) and devm unwinds things in "FILO" order.

This series implements delayed wq cancellation on top of devm and replaces
the obvious cases where only thing remove call-back in a driver does is
cancelling the work. There might be other cases where we could switch
more than just work cancellation to use managed version and thus get rid
of remove or mixed (manual and devm) resource management.

The series introduces include/linux/devm-helpers.h file which
hopefully works as a place where this kind of helpers can be inlined.

Please see previous discussion here:
RFC v1:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1613216412.git.matti.vaittinen@fi.rohmeurope.com/

Changelog v3:
  - Dropped RFC as advieced by Greg.
  - No functional changes.

Changelog RFC v2 resend:
  - rebased on 5.12-rc4

Changelog RFC v2:
  - used correct terminology ("driver detach" instead of "exit, ...")
  - inlined the devm_delayed_work_autocancel() in a header
  - added Hans as a maintainer for the new header + myself as a reviewer
  - used devm_add_action() instead of using plain devres_add()
