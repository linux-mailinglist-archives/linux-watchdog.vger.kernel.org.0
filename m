Perhaps it's because I'm not a native English speaker, but I thought
"either" introduces an alternative between two options (wiktionary
confirms, FWIW). Reading your sentence in that perspective gave it a
different meaning.

You didn't. But since max77620_wdt_info is currently file-scoped, should
it be modified during probe it would generate a weird situation in case
one has both a max77714 and a max77620 on the same board (unlikely but
possible), as two instances of the same driver would modify the same
(static) data.

But all of this discussion is getting quite theoretical as...

...I'll go for this last, simplest option: same struct, same string, always.
