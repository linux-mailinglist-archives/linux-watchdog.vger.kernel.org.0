Changes since v5:
 *Removed generic-ohci and generic-ehci from patchset as they were
 committed to linux-next
 *Removed watchdog node from device tree and dt-bindings documentation
 as it is not necessary since the timer creates it
 *Added cache controller to device tree
 *Fixed l2c initialization by making l2c_aux_map=~1
 *Corrected Kconfig punctuation and wording in mach-hpe
 *Added oneOf to hpe,gxp.yaml
 *Set additionalProperties to false on hpe,gxp-timer
 *Added space after "," in compatible lists
 *Switched hpe,gxp-timer.yaml title to Timer from TIMER
 *Switched clockname from iopclk to iop
 *Added clock labels clock-0 and clock-1 to device tree
 *Added dma-ranges to ahb in device tree
 *Fixed static device issue in timer-gxp.c with platform_device_alloc
 *Fixed timer-gxp.c initialization to exit cleanly
 *Corrected all subjects and descriptions for every commit
 *Added information about bootloader to mach-hpe patch

Changes since v4:
 *Fixed version mismatch with patchset across all patches
 *Fixed typos with ochi -> ohci echi -> ehci
 *Adjusted Watchdog Kconfig file
 *Adjusted various commit comments
 *Removed un-necessary include file
 *Updated outdated base revision to newer one to resolve merge
  conflicts as well as pickup vendor binding change for hpe.

Changes since v3:
 *Completely redid the dtsi file to represent architecture
 *Reduced device tree size
 *Rewrote the timer driver to start the watchdog driver due
 to similar register region
 *Made adjustments to timer
 *Made adjustments to watchdog
 *Changed gxp.yaml to hpe,gxp.yaml with changes
 *Updated Maintainers to represent new file names
 *Added hpe bindings to generic-ehci and generic-ohci
 *Fixed clock architecture to be accurate

Changes since v2:
 *Reduced size of changes, put them into patchset format
 *Changed from txt->yaml

Changes since v1:
 *Fixed compiler warnings

The GXP is the HPE BMC SoC that is used in the majority
of HPE current generation servers. Traditionally the asic will
last multiple generations of server before being replaced.

Info about SoC:

 HPE GXP is the name of the HPE Soc. This SoC is used to implement many
 BMC features at HPE. It supports ARMv7 architecture based on the Cortex
 A9 core. It is capable of using an AXI bus to which a memory controller
 is attached. It has multiple SPI interfaces to connect boot flash and
 BIOS flash. It uses a 10/100/1000 MAC for network connectivity. It has
 multiple i2c engines to drive connectivity with a host infrastructure.
 The initial patches enable the watchdog and timer enabling the host to
 be able to boot.
