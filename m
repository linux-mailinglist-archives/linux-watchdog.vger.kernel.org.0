After this explanation the whole imx7ulp_wdt_init() seems a bit buggy
because writel_relaxed() as well as writel() are 32bit access functions.
So the very first thing to do is to enable the 32-bit mode.

Also this is a explanation worth to be added to the commit message ;)

As written above, writel() as well as writel_relaxed() are not 16-bit
access functions.

So to me it looks as you need first to ensure that 32-bit access mode is
enabled. After that you can write drop the to writel_relaxed() functions
and instead just write:

   writel(UNLOCK, wdt->base + WDOG_CNT);

Also why do we need to unlock the watchdog during imx7ulp_wdt_init()?
This is handled just fine during imx7ulp_wdt_enable() and during
imx7ulp_wdt_set_timeout(). So just drop those relaxed writes and
everything should be fine.

  Marco
