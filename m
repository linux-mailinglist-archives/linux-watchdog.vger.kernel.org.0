'res' is only used in the context of sp5100_request_region_mmio()
and sp5100_release_region_mmio(), and both are called from
sp5100_tco_setupdevice_mmio(). I do not see a need for carrying it around
anywhere else, including efch_read_pm_reg8() and efch_update_pm_reg8().

efch_read_pm_reg8() is only called from sp5100_tco_setupdevice_mmio(),
and it only uses struct sp5100_tco *tco to get the address. I don't see
why the address can not be passed to it directly.

efch_update_pm_reg8() also uses tco only to get the address. Again, passing
it instead of a pointer to sp5100_tco *tco would easily be possible.

efch_update_pm_reg8() is only called fromm sp5100_tco_setupdevice_mmio(),
where the change would be easy. It is also called from tco_timer_enable(),
which in turn is called from sp5100_tco_timer_init(). This, again, is called
from sp5100_tco_setupdevice_mmio(). Since the first operation in
sp5100_tco_timer_init() is to call tco_timer_enable() and that function
does nothing but calling efch_update_pm_reg8(), it would easily be possible
to pull out that code from tco_timer_enable() and move it into
sp5100_tco_setupdevice_mmio().

So, no, I neither see the need for having the information in struct
sp5100_tco nor for keeping it in its own structure. If you'd merge
sp5100_request_region_mmio() and sp5100_release_region_mmio() into
sp5100_tco_setupdevice_mmio() you would not even need any pointers
to pass the values from sp5100_request_region_mmio(). Otherwise you
could have sp5100_request_region_mmio() return a pointer to res or
an ERR_PTR, and pass the address as pointer parameter.
