I got some answers - and I was wrong. This device is capable of more than watchdog functionality. On this platform it does provide some temperature sensors (it could do fan control but the device is fanless so that's moot).

My understanding is this means the right way forward is to create a MFD driver. I played with this a bit, and think I understand what is involved - but wanted to check if there were any recommendations on the following plan:

 - Create a lenovo-think-mfd driver. We'd use this to probe the system (DMI) and then match it up with our platforms and use appropriate mfd_cells.
 - Initially we'd target the device on the SE10. We also have the watchdog driver for the SE30 (NCT6692D device) that I think may be a good candidate too.
 - Create a new lenovo-se10-wdt watchdog driver, that would be linked to the MFD driver. 
 - (Once confirmed) do the same for the lenovo-se30-wdt driver.
 - I'm going to look at the temp sensors for the SE10, but don't plan on having that in the initial patchset. It's something we'd add at a later date.

If that's all logical - are there any preferences as to how these come in as commits?
I'm guessing one for the mfd driver, one for the SE10 watchdog, one for the SE30 watchdog?
Documentation would need to be updated as well.
Anything else that would be important?

Would appreciate if you can let me know if I'm missing anything or if I'm heading in the wrong direction.

Thanks
Mark
