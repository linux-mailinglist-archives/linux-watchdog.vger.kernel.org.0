To Rafal's defense, we could have defined the bcm7038-wdt binding such
that the watchdog would have been at 0x28 from the beginning of the
timer block, but as I wrote earlier, that same watchdog which is really
just 8 bytes worth of register is sometimes instantiated on its own
without the rest of the timer block. This is not visible in a DTS that
is upstream but it does happen in some of the Cable Modem chips. That
was the main motivation for defining the binding the way it was, such
that we could just map those 8 bytes wherever they are.

Datasheets are not public however sharing the structures documenting the
register layout is something that is possible. For consistency, if we do
let 4908 define the watchdog to include that 0x28 offset, then we are
not mapping just the watchdog, but the entire timer block, which then
raises the question of what happens to the timer interrupt enable/status
and timer registers, how do we end-up sub-dividing that register space
in a logical manner.
