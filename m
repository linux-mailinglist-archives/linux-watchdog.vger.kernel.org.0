Also Exynos850 as I pointed out previously. I think that is the wrong approach
and very confusing. This SoC is not commonly known by anyone as
Exynos9845.

The same as the Exynos850 isn't known by anyone apart from Samsung folks
as Exynos 3830, and the tesla fsd SoC isn't known by whatever internal Samsung
name that presumably had.

Maybe Alim can comment what tesla fsd SoC has in the product id register.

Where does this 'almost 100%' number come from? Are you measuring the die

You are correct. William clarified that point for us. Thanks William!

This should not be considered an exhaustive list, but whilst looking in the
downstream public drivers at least the following Google IPs in the SoC

TPU/ML accelerator
Bigocean av1 video accelerator
Emerald hill compression engine
Camera ISP blocks
(AoC) Always on Compute

Plus of course Arm IPs (CPU+GPU), Synopsis IPs (USB, PCI. phys) etc.

The Exynos based IPs tend to be for things like pinmux, clocks, i2c, spi,
uart, mfc, display controller, timer etc.

I think RPi / Broadcom is a very different situation to this. The original SoC
in RPi 1 was wholly designed by Broadcom, and marketed as a Broadcom
SoC [1].

Further iterations of the SoC until now have also not had RPi IP integrated.
RPi themselves refer to them as "Broadcom SoCs" on their webpage [2],
so it is completely expected that they live in a broadcom directory.

BCM2717 has integrated the RPi ISP, but to all intents and purposes this is a
Broadcom owned and designed SoC, albeit only now sold to one customer.

It is going by its real name :) just not by its internal name that nobody has
heard of.

I expect Google, or Google sponsored devs (as is the case for Linaro) to be
helping maintain the Google SoCs upstream. See the MAINTAINERS entry
for this series of who I expect to maintain this google directory.

That is correct, it is named Zuma downstream and they did away with the
gs101, gs201 type naming scheme.

As you can see from this series we are not proposing that. Any IPs that
use Exynos IP we are using the existing upstream driver and enhance
it where we have features that aren't present upstream.

Who manufactures it seems irrelevant. Qcom and Broadcom don't
manufacture their SoCs either, but they still live in qcom and broadcom
directories upstream. Whether they designed the SoC from scratch or not
is also IMO largely irrelevant. In many cases the upstream community
has no way to determine whether things were outsourced or not anyway.
Did Apple outsource things in their silicon design? Who knows, and why
do we care? It's an apple branded chip in an apple branded product
let's call the directory apple.

Interestingly apple uses the same uart driver as Tensor, when I check back
through the commits in the driver.

fcbba344907afe26da487f1ed0b0e285c06a547b

tty: serial: samsung_tty: Add support for Apple UARTs

Apple SoCs are a distant descendant of Samsung designs and use yet
 another variant of their UART style, with different interrupt handling.

Also the fact that they contain IPs not found in Samsung designed devices,
aren't known to most people as Exynos, and the maintenance issues of
having all the Google, Tesla, Axis, Exynos based SoCs in the same directory
(and who knows how many other ASIC customers in the future).

Ultimately it is Krzysztof's decision I think. I followed what he had previously
accepted for other SoCs for consistency and also because it seemed like the
correct approach to help scale up and ease the maintenance burden. If I look
at the number of tensor based SoCs, phones per SoC and board variants per
phone model, then you end up having a lot of files in the exynos directory over
time.

Peter
