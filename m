So in the future if we happen to want to manage the hardware timers in
that block, they would be part of the watchdog driver? I am fairly sure
they won't be, so you will be creating a composite driver/MFD to
separate out the functions, more likely. So you might as well create
sub-nodes.

Sorry but not, this is getting completely ridiculous, the

I sort of disagree here, the watchdog is a part of a sundry timer block
here, but it is logically broken up into different parts and if if I
were to imagine how this would map into different drivers, I can easily
see that we would have:

- a driver to manage the timer interrupt controller
- a driver to manage each of the 3 hardware timers, be they clockevent
or else
- a driver to manage the watchdog

The simplest way to get there, and also because these same timer blocks
are actually spread in other parts of STB chips just like the watchdog
is, but in a different layout where they stand on their own was the main
drive for defining the bcm7038_wdt binding the way it was.

Rafal, I appreciate that you are trying to leverage the bcm7038_wdt
driver and this is better than the previous patch set, but I really do
not see why having the watchdog driver not manage the *exact* subset of
the register space needed (starting at 0x28) is not being done.
