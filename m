With the visible context above, at least after chrome already much better, no?

Hmm... Maybe I mixed something... Let me check.
For now than it's okay.

For generic ones, yes.

This is strange. For example, regmap APIs never returns amount of data written
or read. I think it's solely depends on the API. It might be useful for i²c
APIs, in case you can do something about it. but if you have wrappers on top
of that already (meaning not using directly the i2c_*() calls, I dunno the
positive return is anyhow useful.

Perhaps, it's a thing in a category "TIL", and it seems we have so few callers
of that.

TBH sounds good, but I close to never had heard about such a distinction in
a Linux kernel source file(s).

It's not bad per se, just put yourself on the place of somebody who would like
to understand the semantics of all these variables. Maybe you can add a comment
on top explaining that (in short)?

It just makes harder to get the code, because of possible unneeded questions
like "if it's a signed type, maybe it's on purpose?"

Pre-increment usually also a sign of something special about the iterator
variable. In non-special cases we use post-increment. And if you count
the use of each you will see the difference.

Depends how really useful they are. If you think it's way to go, go for it.

Yes, but why likely() is needed? So, i.o.w. what's the benefit in _this_ case?

Are these being generated, or also statically written in that repo?
If the latter, I think better to use more unique naming schema in
the kernel.
