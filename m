Thanks guys.
I am poor with the terminology so I do appreciate your help in getting
this right. I can change this for the v2.

Thanks for the discussion. I hope we can come to some conclusion here.
Unsurprisingly I agree with Hans here. I did after all send this patch
series :) I guess I am mostly just repeating what he said.

As Hans pointed out, when all calls are 'undone' by devm the order of
'undoing' is highly likely to be correct as the unwinding is done in
reverse order to initializations. I think it is sane to assume in most
case things are initiated in order where operations which depend on
something are done last - and when 'unwinding' things those are
'undone' first. 

My 'gut feeling' for probe / remove related errors is that the most
usual errors I've seen have been:

a) Tear-down completely forgotten
b) Tear-down forgotten at error path
c) Wrong order of initiating things (IRQ requested prior resource
initialization)
d) Wrong order of cleann-up at remove.

a) and b) class errors have been the most common ones I've seen. They
can be completely avoided when devm is used.
c) is there no matter if we use devm or not.
d) is mostly avoided when only devm is used - mixing devm and manual
operations make this more likely as Hans pointed out. As long as we
have some devm operations we should help avoid mixing devm and manual
clean-up.
