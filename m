Presumably CONFIG_WATCHDOG_SYSFS is not enabled in your configuration.

sudo apt-get install watchdog
man watchdog

should tell you. Alternatively, enable CONFIG_WATCHDOG_SYSFS.

Not that I know of. I suspect, though, that you either have a hard lockup
where even NMI is non-operational, or NMI doesn't work in your system
to start with.

If you have nmi_watchdog=1 in your kernel command line, /proc/interrupts
should show a non-zero number of NMI interrupts. Do you see that in your system ?
