Honesty, I don't care too much about where the files are kept. I agree it makes
sense to keep them with the other Exynos DT files due to similarities with the
other Exynos SoCs. I think the grouping based on vendor under the exynos folder
make a lot of sense though considering how many DT files we will accumulate
over time.

This is something we (Peter and I) are wanting to discuss at LPC next week.
We've included it in our slides and hope there will be enough folks there to
have a good discussion.

I think organizing the DT files based on a product is relevant because it makes
it easier to identify what files are associated with the final product(s).
Leaving it up to the user just means you are forcing everyone to roll their own
scripts to re-organize/postprocess the kernel artifacts for their products.
I think it would be nice to be able to configure the kernel build to generate
artifacts that are directly usable on the device.

gs101 is used in the downstream drivers as well as referenced in online
materials referring to Pixel 6 (just search for "Google gs101"). In addition,
gs101 is used by the Android userspace to refer to the SoC that Pixel 6/6
Pro/6a use. The same goes for gs201 and zuma.  So I think it's important to
keep the names consistent. I don't think the Exynos 9845 is ever referenced in
the Android vendor userspace nor is it ever used by tech bloggers/writer/
enthusiast developers when referring to the Pixel 6 device. So if upstream
decides to use the term 9845, they will just be introducing even more
confusion.

I also want to point out that I don't really like the Tensor name either. This
is equivalent to the "Snapdragon" marketing name that is not used either in the
Qualcomm device tree. In my opinion, gs101 is equivant to the "msmXYZ" and
"smXYZ" names, e.g. msm8996 and sm8650.
