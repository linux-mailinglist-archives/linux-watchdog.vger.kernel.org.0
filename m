I can only see me accepting that if it is consistent across chips.
I am perfectly fine with using that offset and including the timer region,
but then you'd have to change the code and devicetree files for existing
chips as well to be consistent across chips. I can not see that happening.

To me it seems that the rules for assigning memory regions in devicetree
files are being changed, and the brunt of those changes is pushed into
driver code, making it messy (plus, it would create messy devicetree files,
some including the offset and some not). I do not think this is a good idea,
and I strongly object to it. I don't mind if rules are changed, but please
do it for new chips and bindings, chips which require new drivers, not
when adding devices to existing bindings.
