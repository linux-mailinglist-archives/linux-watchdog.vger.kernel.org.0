Thanks for the suggestion. That's not going to help much when the
system reboots instantly as soon as the device node is accessed, but
maybe it will bring some light about what happens before that point.

OK, thanks for confirming.

I looked for that macro but my grep wouldn't find it because I expected
a value in bytes not bits. Thanks for pointing it out.

Maybe we should introduce ACPI_ACCESS_BYTE_WIDTH() for the purpose?
This would make the code less convoluted than ACPI_ACCESS_BIT_WIDTH() /
8.

I'll write the patch, no problem.
