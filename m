No, quite the contrary, I want you to keep the entire 7 patches that
converted the bcm7038-wdt binding to YAML and get rid of the bcm63xx-wdt
changes, the branch that you have right now is good in that regard.

I don't see why you should be creating an immutable branch for Lee and
not simply merge Rafal's "[PATCH V4 RESEND 2/2] dt-bindings: mfd: add
Broadcom's Timer-Watchdog block" patch with Lee's ack directly. This is
a new file, so I don't see how it would create conflicts as long as we
don't pile up changes on top.
