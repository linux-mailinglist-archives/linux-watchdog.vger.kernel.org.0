It is quite possible that my understanding of it is incomplete or wrong.

This is what led me to my assumptions: The simple-bus validation logic
in dtc complains about unit addresses such as nand@1,0 which are quite
appropriate for the eLBC.

As of now, yes, that's correct. Without simple-bus, a current Linux
kernel doesn't find the device nodes inside such a localbus.

I have prepared such a patch, based on the same assumptions:

  [PATCH] powerpc/fsl_lbc: Explicitly populate bus
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250209-localbus-v1-1-efcd780153a0@posteo.net/

Yes, that's the same as my reasoning.

I'm inclined to agree with you, but it's somewhat beyond my skill level.

I'll let Li Yang or Rob Herring comment on that.

As far as I'm aware, this reflects common practice today.

Yes.

fsl,elbc-gpcm-uio is handled in the following patch
(dt-bindings: memory-controllers: Add fsl,elbc-gpcm-uio).

simple-periph is something I haven't thought about, because this whole
example comes from the old txt-format binding. The whole purpose of
fsl,elbc-gpcm-uio is to allow userspace drivers to interact with
localbus devices, so that doesn't make the intention any clearer, either.

Ah, fsl,mpc8568mds-bcsr for example, good point. I'll add it back.
