Then I believe we are in agreement, the binding is defined the way it is
for the bcm7038-wdt such that the "reg" property must be taking the 0x28
offset from the beginning of the timer block into account. Therefore
4908 must conform and do the same thing for consistency.

If this is not a good practice, then I will keep that in mind and we
will try not to repeat that bad pattern.
