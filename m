There is no requirement that an MFD have child nodes. They are done
both ways. If you need some internal kernel restructuring, then I
don't care (as DT maintainer).

We very commonly have a single node that's both clock and reset
provider for example. It's primarily when the sub blocks consume
different DT resources that you need sub-nodes.

You know the h/w better than me. I was giving my opinion based only on
the limited information presented.

A sub-block reused in different blocks is a decent reason for sub-nodes.

Most important for me is that the binding be complete and not have to
change in an incompatible way in the future. The more detailed you
make the binding, the harder it will be to get right. It's the same
reason we moved away from doing a clock per node for clock trees. So,
if you want child nodes, then you need to define all of them.
