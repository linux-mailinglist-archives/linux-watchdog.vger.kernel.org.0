Need more B12 ;) Can't remember a minor discussion just a few thousand
other patch mails ago? Huh, that's what the age does, right :p

I thought you meant that literally, Hans assumed you were joking - and
you don't remember how it was :] So - if no further suggestions, then

device.h. Although the malloc/free stuff is not really strictly device
thing.
