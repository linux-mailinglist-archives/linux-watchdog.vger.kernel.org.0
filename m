You are introducing qemu,virt-watchdog, so it seems to me that any argument
along that line doesn't really apply.

I think it is more a matter for core kernel developers to discuss and
decide how this functionality is best instantiated. It doesn't _have_
to be a device, after all, just like the current lockup detection
code is not a device. Either case, I am not really the right person
to discuss this since it is a matter of core kernel code which I am
not sufficiently familiar with. All I can say is that watchdog drivers
in the watchdog subsystem have a different scope.
