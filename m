You don't have to according the RM:
8<----------------------------------------------------------------------
59.5.2 Disable Watchdog after Reset

All of watchdog registers are unlocked by reset. Therefore, unlock
sequence is unnecessary, but it needs to write all of watchdog registers
to make the new configuration take effect. The code snippet below shows
an example of disabling watchdog after reset.
8<----------------------------------------------------------------------

also the RM tells us:
8<----------------------------------------------------------------------
59.4.3.1 Configuring the Watchdog Once

The new configuration takes effect only after all registers except CNT
are written after reset. Otherwise, the WDOG uses the reset values by
default. If window mode is not used (CS[WIN] is 0), writing to WIN is
not required to make the new configuration take effect.
8<----------------------------------------------------------------------

So.. after reading the IMX7ULP RM, which was not my intention, I found
out that most of the WDOG_CS regiter bits are write-once bits. This
means if you didn't set it within the bootloader you still in case
"59.4.3.1".

So the imx7ulp_wdt_init() function just needs to check if the
WDOG_CS_UPDATE bit was set. If it is not the case, then you need to
write the WDOG_CS register as currently done. If the bit is set, than
you need know that the bootloader did the job for you and you can exit
imx7ulp_wdt_init() early. In both cases the unlock is not required.

Can you please check/test if this is working for you?

  Marco
