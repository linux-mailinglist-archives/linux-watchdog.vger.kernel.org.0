Ack - we can look at those. Thanks for the feedback.

Afraid I'm still missing something here. If we make it so this driver is only used on the SE10 platform, then does that remove the concern? At that point it's specific to that HW platform and no HW changes are planned.
Agreed that having this available generically is not a good idea.

I'm in agreement we should tie this to the platform - we'll make that change. No insistence implied :)

Afraid I don't understand the point about the chip not existing in public - do you just mean publicly available datasheets? At the risk of being repetitive, if this driver is locked to the Lenovo SE10 platform does that address the concerns?

Yeah, ack to that - and in that's something we need to address going forward in contracts we set for platforms that will have Linux support. I can't change what has already been done I'm afraid. We do have access, under NDA, to more details - but we're also limited in what we can disclose.
I need to go look at the details for this again, with David, and see what we can do to address any questions; but there are going to be some limits I'm afraid and I'm hoping they aren't blockers.
The aim is to get a driver working for this platform in shape enough to get accepted upstream and be useful.

OK - we may also have used some incorrect terminology inadvertently, so I don't want to jump to too many conclusions. Will look into this.

Thanks for the detailed notes - we weren't sure what had been missing from the driver since the last submission so it's helpful to know where improvements are needed. 
Appreciate the patience as this is a learning experience for us for this kernel sub-tree.
