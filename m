Great, thanks for the info.

As I read the specification, it is mandatory to have a timeout >= 5
minutes *if* the watchdog is enabled at boot time. Otherwise the 5
minutes is only a recommendation. I wouldn't be surprised if some
hardware vendors do not initialize the timeout value and assume the OS
will do it for them. Odds are that Windows does that.

Thanks again,
