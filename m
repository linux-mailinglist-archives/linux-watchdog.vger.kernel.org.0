There is one unknown in this equation, and that is the anti-email system
operated by a our IT and some company in Redmond. But I haven't received
any complaints that my outgoing emails are negatively affected by it
(incoming are, but that's a different story...). If you received
something mangled, Andy, please share the source of that email. I'm
happy to escalate internally - and externally.

For the potential case they were mangled or in case I'm submitting via a
real email provider, my scripts always add a "From:" to the body of my
patches. Outgoing, that From matched my Signed-off.
