That's a good argument. Indeed BCM2712 contains "New Raspberry
Pi-developed ISP".
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/processors.html

There aren't many patches but GPU is still called brcm,2712.

For Tesla FSD, there was discussion and output was not very consisting.
First, the name itself was used for everything - SoC architecture, one
given SoC and eventually the board.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/5ab62673-8d46-ec1d-1c80-696421ab69ca@canonical.com/

Eventually the last part - board - was renamed to "Evaluation board",
but I don't know how true or real it is.

See also:
"I would argue that if this SoC shares the pinctrl, clock, spi, adc,
and timer implementation
with Exynos, we should consider it part of the Exynos family,"
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAK8P3a31bCHNcNWrLX+QW+4RuK=DBpxLA_j5BFKxXxXKCT8PFQ@mail.gmail.com/

However it was also claimed:

"AFA architecture is concerns both Exynos and FSD has completely
different architecture (at least at HW level)."
https://lore.kernel.org/all/07ce01d8091e$9a6fd9c0$cf4f8d40$@samsung.com/

The initial technical name does not exist outside of vendor sources and
part name. E.g. Winlink E850 board hardware manual calls it:
"Samsung Exynos 850, S5E3830"
and everywhere else Exynos 850 SoC is used.

If you start calling it Exynos 3830, only me and Sam (who mainlined it)
would know what is it. Everyone else, all users of kernel, would be
confused.

Therefore using well known final product name is for Exynos850 reasonable.

That's indeed a problem. Future Tesla SoC might have just few pieces
similar to FSD. There would be no common SoC part, except the actual
Tesla IP.

Same for Google. Future GSXXX, if done by Qualcomm, will be absolutely
different than GS101 and the only common part would be the TPU (Tensor).

So now let's decide what is the common denominator:
1. Core SoC architecture, like buses, pinctrl, clocks, timers, serial,
and many IP blocks, which constitute 95% of Devicetree bindings and drivers,
2. The one, big piece made by Samsung's customer: TPU, NPU or whatever.

For some reason, although I know which, Cc-list is here trimmed and
misses Alim...

So standard reply follow (it makes me really, really grumpy, because it
means you develop on some crazy old kernel or do not use tools which
automate the process):

Please use scripts/get_maintainers.pl to get a list of necessary people
and lists to CC (and consider --no-git-fallback argument). It might
happen, that command when run on an older kernel, gives you outdated
entries. Therefore please be sure you base your patches on recent Linux
kernel.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
