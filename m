Just try to find information about this chip anywhere. The only evidence that the
chip even exists appears to be this submission.

I can't say that I am surprised. It is quite common for chips from ITE.
Most of them seem to be custom builds made for specific customers/boards,
with little if any information available. People providing tools for Windows
can often sign NDAs with board vendors to get the information they need to
implement support in those tools. Unfortunately that isn't an option for
Linux kernel maintainers.

And I still have no idea if this an EC or not ;-). My best guess would
be that it is an NDS32 based micro-controller, related to IT5671.

Of course, the next question would be if this chip has additional
functionality, such as hardware monitoring. I guess I'll see that
when I get a patch introducing its hwmon driver.
