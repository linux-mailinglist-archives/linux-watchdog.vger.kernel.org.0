I guess the current solution is to set WatchdogDevice to point to a link
that is updated by udev thus ensuring it points to the correct watchdog
device regardless of the probe order.

This would be similar to the /dev/rtc symlink, pointing to the systohc
RTC by default (even if I don't really like that heuristic).

What you suggest is somewhat okay but doesn't really solve the issue if
both watchdogs are functional and systemd still doesn't pick the one
that is armed by the bootloader.
