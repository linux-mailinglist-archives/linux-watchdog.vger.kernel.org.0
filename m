Could you please point me to the WDAT specification? Somehow my web
search failed to spot it.

That is a very valid point. We know that the device works fine when
using the iTCO_wdt driver, and the iTCO_wdt driver *does* set a timeout
value at probe time, it does not rely on the BIOS having set a sane
value beforehand. So maybe that's the problem.

Guenter, what is considered best practice for watchdog drivers in this
respect? Trust the BIOS or set an arbitrary timeout value?

Maybe we should read the timeout value before enabling the device, and
if it is unreasonably low (< 5 seconds), log a warning and reset the
value to a sane default (30 seconds)?

Alternatively, or in addition to that, maybe the wdat_wdt driver should
have a module parameter to set the default timeout value, as the
iTCO_wdt driver has? Or is this deprecated in favor of the
WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT ioctl? Problem with the ioctl is that it requires the
device node to be opened, which starts the count down (I think?)
