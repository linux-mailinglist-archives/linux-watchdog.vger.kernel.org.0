Agreed, especially since other sub-devices of bcm4908 are alredy modeled
this way. See arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm4908/bcm4908.dtsi.
At this point, before accepting anything, I'll want to have an explanation
how and why the watchdog interface is handled differently than, say,
its reset controller. Also, I'd like to understand the memory region
assigned to bcm7038, which happens to be something like:

     compatible = "brcm,bcm7038-wdt";
         reg = <0xf040a7e8 0x16>;

because it seems unlikely that this is a chip subsystem that just happens
to start at such an odd boundary. More specifically, I see in actual
.dtsi files data such as:

                 watchdog: watchdog@4066a8 {
                         clocks = <&upg_clk>;
                         compatible = "brcm,bcm7038-wdt";
                         reg = <0x4066a8 0x14>;
                         status = "disabled";
                 };
...
                 timers: timer@406680 {
                         compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-timers";
                         reg = <0x406680 0x40>;
                 };

So there happen to be timers in the same region, and the offset
between timer and watchdog registers is 0x28. Coincidentally, that
just happens to be the extra offset defined in this patch for the
bcm4908 watchdog. Really ? Sorry, this sounds very inconsistent
and arbitrary to me.

Overall, I suspect I'll have to see datasheets if we really end up
having different offsets for each chip, because I'll want to confirm
that the watchdog subsystem isn't treated differently than other
subsystems, and that the offset calculations are appropriate and
consistent across the different chips.
