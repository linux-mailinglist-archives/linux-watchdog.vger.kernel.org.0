I honestly don't care too much about where the DT files are stored --
arch/arm64/boot/dts/exynos vs .../dts/google. I didn't think this would be such
a hot topic! If this makes it easier for you to maintain, then so be it.

Just to note, I do understand what I proposed is something new -- group DT
files based on product owner vs original SoC designer -- and think it warrants
consideration since it does make it easier to distinguish which DT files are
associated with each product as well as package and distribute them easily, but
that can be a discussion for another time when we get more upstreamed.

Thanks,
Will
