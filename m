I understand that the patches don't meet the expected quality standards.
The compile issue is due to my MFD core driver, which is currently under
review and has not been merged yet.

I would also like to seek your advice on how to best proceed with the
sub-drivers like the watchdog driver. Should I wait for my core MFD
driver to be successfully merged before submitting the sub-drivers, or
let Jones Lee review my core MFD driver and all its sub-drivers, or is
there another approach that you recommend?

I also appreciate your patience, dedication, and valuable contributions
to the Linux community. Your longstanding efforts and expertise are
commendable and have been instrumental in advancing the Linux ecosystem.
I understand that upstream review can be a meticulous and vital, albeit
thankless, task. I don't want my actions to cause any inconvenience or
distress, especially to someone as esteemed as you are in the Linux
community. Your insights and guidance are incredibly valuable to all of
us.

Once again, thank you for your understanding, and I am committed to
delivering high-quality code for your review.

Best regards,
Wenkai
