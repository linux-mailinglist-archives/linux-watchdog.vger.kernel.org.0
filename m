Yes, the gs101 SoC is *not* equivalent to the Exynos9845. Similar to how Tesla
FSD licenses Exynos IP blocks, gs101 does not only comprise of Exynos IP
blocks. The final design is unique to Google and comprises of several different
vendor IP blocks (not only Exynos).

I agree with this. By using the final (well known) product SoC name -- gs101 --
other developers will be able to easily identify the particular SoC.

I don't understand why the architecture of the SoC would dictate which folder
to put the device tree files under. It makes more sense to group board DT files
together based on who distributes them. Having all the Pixel DT board files
together allows Google to create a single device tree binary per SoC coupled
with the set of device tree overlays per board variant (this is the dtbo.img)
to ship to all their devices. If you look at all the in-market Pixel devices
with Tensor SoCs, you will find that you could create one dtb (concatenate
gs101.dtb, gs201.dtb, and zuma.dtb) and one dtbo image for 10 devices which
significantly simplifies the maintenance, testing, and software distribution
for all 10 of those products.

As mentioned above, I think this should be based on how the DTBs and DTBOs are
used and distributed. What is the benefit of adding the gs101 board files under
the exynos folder?
