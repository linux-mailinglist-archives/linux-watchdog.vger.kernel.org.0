Are mutexes intended to be used in situations where one function 
acquires the lock, then returns, and then a different function releases 
the lock?  I'm not sure about this.

Perhaps a good old semaphore would be more appropriate.  But it's clear 
that I/O to the device does need to be mutually exclusive with resets, 
one way or another.
