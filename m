It isn't needed as the driver doesn't list the IDs. If that would
be true, it would be sufficient to put them into a header next to the
driver or defined inside the driver C file.

The defined IDs here are intended to be used in device tree files.

Because the wdt on MT7988 has a total of 24 resets. Most of them are
(currently, as there are no GPL drops, no publicly available devices,
...) undocumented and are not used in Linux **at this point**. Having
to change the driver every time a new reset is discovered or needed to
be used is tideous, so I thought the best would be -- as we know the
total number of resets -- to already define that, as it's safe to do
and won't need to change.

This line can indeed go into the driver, it's not used anywhere else.
I was merely immitating the style of all the existing binding headers
for similar SoCs and didn't want to stick-out style-wise, also in terms
of the added code to the driver which relies on that number being
defined in the header for all other SoCs.

I have answered to this before:
The driver does NOT have any internal list of names of individual
resets, it relies on the reset number from device tree matching the bit
in the controller, just like for any other MediaTek toprgu already
supported by mtk-wdt.c.
