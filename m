Hello Mark,

Thanks for taking a look at the series! This is the first time anyone
has been commenting on a cover-letter which is likely to fade away and
never be looked at again. Guess you are a thorough person :)

I am not sure how many drivers are needed to change it from 'few' to 'a
few'. Additionally, this series converted only the drivers which I
found could easily get rid of the .remove() - I did not analyze how
many drivers would benefit from this by getting rid of mixed
devm/manual resource management.

So to sum up - I don't know how many drivers will benefit and what
people think makes 'few' to turn to 'a few'. '(a) few' leaves this
decision to readers - and (a) few of them know the drivers better than
I do.

Hm. The 'own file for XXX' does not make sense for native English
speakers? Didn't now that. Thanks for pointing it out.

I will edit the cover letter when I respin this rebased on v5.12-rc1 -
and it is likely the series v2 will add this function inlined in a new
header dedicated for devm-helpers (as was suggested by Hans de Goede).

Best Regards
