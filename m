As said, the writel_relaxed() is also 32bit writes. Please just use the
correct APIs for the stuff you wanna do. In your case, if you want 16bit
access functions you need to use writew() function and you can drop the
mb(). But after reading the RM again, I think you can go with writel()
since 32bit writes are okay, but you need to pass the two 16bit unlock
commands. For that you just need to ensure that the timing is correct,
as noted in the RM.

Also I read that the WDOG1 is only programmed in serial downloader mode
to reset the device if no activity was found on the serial/usb bus. Also
this only happen if the fuse for it was burned, but the RM says also:
"The watchdog is enabled by default after reset.". Can you please read
the Watchdog status register and post it here?

Also after after reading the RM I found the ULK bit "This read-only bit
indicates whether WDOG is unlocked or not." If this bit is 0 the device
is locked and we need a unlock command else we can just write the config
to the device. The unlock command can than be: two writel() commands
which are adding the barriers for free.

  Marco
