I am trying to follow your guidelines to make this work, so I would be grateful
if you have some time to share your thoughts on this.

This watchdog device tracks the elapsed time on a per-cpu basis, since KVM
schedules vCPUs independently.
I am attempting to re-write it to use the watchdog-core infrastructure but
doing this will loose the per-cpu watchdog binding and exposing it to
userspace would require a strong thread affinity setting. How can I overcome
this problem ?

Having it like a hard lockup detector mechanism doesn’t work either because
when the watchdog expires, we rely on crosvm (not the guest kernel) to handle
this event and reset the machine. We cannot inject the reset event back into
the guest as we don’t have NMI support on arm64.
