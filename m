I'd use v4 keeping the change-log and adding a link with hint to v3 in the cover 
letter.

Yes, otherwise the version number doesn't make to much sense.

use v6 explaining where in the mailing list one can find v5.

Same here, use v4.

use v7 here.

Respond to any review comments in the thread but once you are ready to send a 
new version of the patch, send the whole series with an incremented

beware: applied != accepted
reviewer != maintainer

if the patch got applied to some maintainer repo, then in the next version drop 
that patch (it is already applied) but mention that in the cover letter.

This series would be v3, if 1/3 is applied, drop. 2/3 will have changes and 3/3 
will be the same as in v2.

yes, that's how is expected you send your patches.

Let me know if you have any further questions :)
