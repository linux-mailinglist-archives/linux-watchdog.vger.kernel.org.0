This updates bindings for MT7986 pinctrl driver. The
difference of pinctrl between mt7986a and mt7986b is that pin-41 to pin-65
do not exist on mt7986b

+* Mediatek MT7986 Pin Controller
+
+The Mediatek's Pin controller is used to control SoC pins.
+
+Required properties for the root node:
+ - compatible: Should be one of the following
+	       "mediatek,mt7986a-pinctrl" for MT7986a SoC
+	       "mediatek,mt7986b-pinctrl" for MT7986b SoC
+ - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
+ - #gpio-cells: number of cells in GPIO specifier. Since the generic GPIO
+   binding is used, the amount of cells must be specified as 2. See the below
+   mentioned gpio binding representation for description of particular cells.
+ - gpio-ranges : gpio valid number range.
+ - reg: physical address base for gpio base registers. There are 8 GPIO
+   physical address base in mt8183.
+
+Optional properties:
+- reg-names: gpio base register names. There are 8 gpio base register
+  names in mt7986. They are "gpio_base", "iocfg_rt_base", "iocfg_rb_base",
+  "iocfg_lt_base", "iocfg_lb_base", "iocfg_tr_base", "iocfg_tl_base", "eint".
+- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller
+
+If the property interrupt-controller is defined, following property is required
+- interrupts : The interrupt outputs to gic.
+- #interrupt-cells: Should be two.
+
+Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
+common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
+phrase "pin configuration node".
+
+MT7986 pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
+subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for a
+pin, a group, or a list of pins or groups. This configuration can include the
+mux function to select on those pin(s)/group(s), and various pin configuration
+parameters, such as pull-up, drive-strength, etc.
+
+We support 2 types of configuration nodes. Those nodes can be either pinmux
+nodes or pinconf nodes. Each configuration node can consist of multiple nodes
+describing the pinmux and pinconf options.
+
+The name of each subnode doesn't matter as long as it is unique; all subnodes
+should be enumerated and processed purely based on their content.
+
+== pinmux nodes content ==
+
+The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
+to specify in a pinmux subnode:
+
+Required properties are:
+ - groups: An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a group.
+  Valid values for these names are listed below.
+ - function: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the
+  group. Valid values for function names are listed below.
+
+== pinconf nodes content ==
+
+The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
+to specify in a pinconf subnode:
+
+Required properties are:
+ - pins: An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a pin.
+  Valid values for these names are listed below.
+ - groups: An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a group.
+  Valid values for these names are listed below.
+
+Optional properies are:
+ - GENERIC_PINCONFIG: is the generic pinconfig options to use, bias-disable,
+   bias-pull-down, bias-pull-up, input-enable, input-disable, output-low,
+   output-high, input-schmitt-enable, input-schmitt-disable
+   and drive-strength are valid.
+  Valid arguments for 'drive-strength': 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 in mA.
+ - mediatek,pull-up-adv
+  Valid arguments for 'mediatek,pull-up-adv' are '0', '1', '2', '3'
+  Pull up setings for 2 pull resistors, R0 and R1. User can
+  configure those special pins. Valid arguments are described as below:
+  0: (R1, R0) = (0, 0) which means R1 disabled and R0 disabled.
+  1: (R1, R0) = (0, 1) which means R1 disabled and R0 enabled.
+  2: (R1, R0) = (1, 0) which means R1 enabled and R0 disabled.
+  3: (R1, R0) = (1, 1) which means R1 enabled and R0 enabled.
+ - mediatek,pull-down-adv
+  Valid arguments for 'mediatek,pull-down-adv' are '0', '1', '2', '3'
+  Pull down settings for 2 pull resistors, R0 and R1. User can
+  configure those special pins. Valid arguments are described as below:
+  0: (R1, R0) = (0, 0) which means R1 disabled and R0 disabled.
+  1: (R1, R0) = (0, 1) which means R1 disabled and R0 enabled.
+  2: (R1, R0) = (1, 0) which means R1 enabled and R0 disabled.
+  3: (R1, R0) = (1, 1) which means R1 enabled and R0 enabled.
+ - mediatek,tdsel: An integer describing the steps for output level shifter duty
+   cycle when asserted (high pulse width adjustment). Valid arguments are from 0
+   to 15.
+ - mediatek,rdsel: An integer describing the steps for input level shifter duty
+   cycle when asserted (high pulse width adjustment). Valid arguments are from 0
+   to 63.
+
+== Valid values for pins, function and groups on MT7986a and MT7986b  ==
+
+Valid values for pins are:
+pins can be referenced via the pin names as the below table shown and the
+related physical number is also put ahead of those names which helps cross
+references to pins between groups to know whether pins assignment conflict
+happens among devices try to acquire those available pins.
+
+There is no PIN 41 to PIN 65 on mt7686b, you can only use those pins on mt7986a.
