I think the ALIGN() was there just because I did not realize that
access_width is 3 and not 4 for 32-bit memory. So it is not needed.

I actually have a patch series that should fix this and the other issue
you found (I found a couple of spare cycles in the morning) so if you
don't mind I'll submit them soon.
