These are all common to Exynos and usually they use Exynos-specific
glue, so we consider them all Exynos-specific.

Not that different.
Broadcom designed previous chip.
Samsung designed previous chip.
Broadcom designed BCM2717 with RPi ISP.
Samsung designed GS101 with Tensor NPU and other blocks.

That's fine. What I don't agree is with putting it into Google, because
Google wants to have all its phones in one place. That's not the
argument we used for any other SoCs or products.

We do not make decisions based on marketing or packaging wishes of some
company. Otherwise Samsung phones will be together. Toradex boards (also
spanning over NXP and TI) as well. Chromebooks DTS as well (oh, Doug
would be happy, I guess :) ). And so on.

I agreed on Tesla FSD in its own place mainly because of arguments
provided that time: it's entirely different architecture. These
arguments were not backed by actual facts or proofs, though. The
upstreamed parts of FSD turned out to be... only Exynos specific. There
is literally nothing non-Exynos in upstream. Therefore knowing the
outcome I would say: put FSD into samsung directory.

About GS101 I have the same questions - how similar it is? I am pretty
sure that 95% of upstreamed code (DTS and drivers) will be Exynos-like
(except for missing upstream support for generations of Exynos SoC!).
But I cannot really judge and I am not going to investigate downstream
code to figure this out. Thus if you insist that SoC architecture and
core features are quite different from Exynos family, then sure, I can
live with it.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
