Are you saying that some clocks in topck have inputs from infra?
If so, then that's a nasty circular dependency to deal with.

And to be fair, many Mediatek device tree bindings already take a large
number of clocks, so I think adding a few more isn't too bad.

Right. I'm not asking you to do this right away. This will end up being
a long migration over multiple releases. But it makes sense to get the
device tree bindings sorted out first.

I believe the solution is to move to `struct clk_parent_data` to replace
the pure strings. New internal APIs for the Mediatek clock driver would
need to be added, and all the drivers slowly migrated over. Probably also
a good time to migrate to clk_hw_*_register.
