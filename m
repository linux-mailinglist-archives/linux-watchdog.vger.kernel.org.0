If Rob wants `dt_binding_check` to run cleanly in -next, we have to
treat the DT documentation in the same manner we do for real code
when build dependencies exist between patches.  Simply sucking them up
through a single repo is just dandy until subsequent changes are
required, which unfortunately is often the case.

Being the Maintainer of MFD, which is often the centre point of
cross-subsystems patch sets, I've been bitten by this too many times.
Hence my hesitancy to 'just Ack it and be done'.

I've been pushing back on the requirement for clean `dt_binding_check`
runs in -next for a while and would much prefer to treat it the same
way we do `checkpatch.pl`, whereby a clean run is not a hard
requirement.  Instead it is used as one of many tools to check for
inconsistencies prior to submission (as possibly against patch-sets
once they are posted onto the list).  However, just as we see false
positives in `checkpatch.pl` we should see them in `dt_binding_check`
where patches have simply been applied into different trees and may
lag each other by a week or two.

> It sounded to me like Lee wanted an immutable branch for that

Not exactly, I said:

  "> Suppose we should take patch #2 via [Watchdog] as well.

   If that happens, I would like a PR to an immutable branch."

The alternative is that I take the patch and provide an immutable
branch to you, which I am in a position to do.

Of course all of this hassle just goes away if the clean
`dt_binding_check` run on -next requirement is laxed and we can just
take our own patches without fear of wrath.
