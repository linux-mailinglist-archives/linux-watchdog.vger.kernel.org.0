That is only necessary when there are none devm managed resources /
resource-ish things which get manually released in the remove function
(because they are not devm managed), while the IRQ handler depends on
these.

If all resources / resource-ish things used by the IRQ handler are
devm managed then there is no need to have a devm_free_irq() call
in a drivers release (which is called remove) callback.

Things get hairy wrt devm resource handling when some of the resources
are not managed by devm.

Having devm managed sync-cancel of work items is IMHO actually good to
have because it helps avoiding mixing of devm managed resources with
non devm managed resources.

Some drivers are actually already doing devm managed workqueue cancellation
by using the generic devm_add_action() helper which allows calling a
driver supplied cleanup function when devres_release_all() runs.

This is also useful to make sure the workqueue is cancelled at the
right time during tear-down on error-exits from probe(), which
also runs devres_release_all().

See drivers/power/supply/axp288_charger.c for an example of this.

Note that no-one is going to force people to use this new
devm_delayed_work_autocancel() functionality. IMHO it is a useful
tool to have in our toolbox.

We already need to audit probe() functions to make sure that all resources
which the IRQ handlers need are allocated before the IRQ gets requested.

This is why requesting the IRQ is usually one of the last things which
driver's probe functions do.

Using devm (and only devm without mixing and matching) avoids to have to
_also_ audit the probe-error-exit teardown and driver-release paths.
Those will automatically be done in the right order since devm will
release everything in reverse order of allocation.

So this reduces the amount of auditing work we need to do.

In my experience the probe-error-exit teardown and driver-release paths are full
of bugs, bugs which are often never caught because most drivers bind once and then
stay bound until reboot / shutdown so this paths are often not exercised during
testing. So automating this teardown is a good thing to do, it removes a whole
class of bugs.

Here being the gpio_extcon_remove() example ?

Yes that is bad, but again that is due to mixing manual and devm managed
resource management.

Having this new devm_delayed_work_autocancel() helper will allow a
bunch of drivers to move away from mixing the 2, which is a good thing
in my book.

As I said above I believe that having devm_delayed_work_autocancel() (1)
in our toolbox will be a good thing to have. Driver authors can then choose
to use it; or they can choose to not use it if they don't like it.

I know that the reason why I did not use it in the
drivers/extcon/extcon-intel-int3496.c driver is because it was not available
if it had been available then I would definitely have used it, as it avoids the
mixing of resource-management styles which that driver is currently doing.

And I think that that is what this is ultimately about, there are 2 styles
of resource-management:

1. manual
2. devm based

And they both have their pros and cons, problems mostly arise when mixing them
and adding new devm helpers for commonly used cleanup patterns is a good thing
as it helps to get rid of mixing these 2 styles in a single driver.

Hans
