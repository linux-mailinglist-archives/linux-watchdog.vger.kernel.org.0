I am not sure if Exynos 3830 and the like would be *that* confusing to
users. It does not seem like the internal names (like Exynos 3830) are
well guarded secret. The wikipedia article for Exynos even sort of
gives these names for recent Exynos models, Exynos 850 is called
S5E3830 for example, see section for Exynos 800:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exynos#Exynos_800_series

Exynos 9845/S5E9845 is not mentioned in the article though.

Another small benefit of putting GS101 in exynos/ is that it makes it
easier for future contributors to find the code. If someone is for
example trying to add mainline support for their Samsung Galaxy S21
(Exynos 2100/Exynos 9840) and want to find somewhat related boards to
draw inspiration from then it is not clear at a first glance that
google/gs101-* are (somewhat) related.
