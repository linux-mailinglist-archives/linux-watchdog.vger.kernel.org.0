I believe I misunderstood your point, and now that I'm reading it again 
I believe grouping device trees based on device manufacturer is 
definitely an interesting idea and it would definitely make sense for 
e.g. x86, where there's basically two big SoC vendors and all the DTBs 
for the motherboards in just those two folders would result in 
cluttering issues, however it is not currently done in arm64/boot/dts, 
where the subfolders are per-platform (exynos, qcom, mtk, tegra, ...) - 
with an exception of Tesla, which perhaps should be also corrected (also 
CONFIG_ARCH makes it clear what those directory names are actually meant 
to represent).

If you think the current approach should be changed, it should be 
changed for all device-trees, and the CONFIG_ARCH_* should be also 
renamed, but also we'd need to convince everyone that this approach is 
superior to others...

Maybe the solution to this is to have arch/arm64/boot/dts/exynos/google 
with Google's boards, and to have the SoC .dtsi files in 
arch/arm64/boot/dts/exynos, but I'm not sure.

Additionally, I believe using .dtbo files like that (per board variant) 
is not really expected, instead each board should have its own .dtb 
file, compiled from a board .dts file which includes the SoC .dtsi file 
but this is not up to me to judge...
