How is that relevant?

I believe it is none of the kernel concerns, it's up to the user to do 
whatever with the built .dtb files.

Also I do not see an issue in having a file list of all the .dtbo files 
you might want.

One clear benefit would be the ease of maintaining all the SoC files at 
once. It's not that it is a benefit of having it in the Exynos folder, 
it's more like that there's no benefit in having a separate folder, and 
that also comes with some additional issues.

As I said earlier, it's pretty similar to the Raspberry Pi 5 example: It 
contains Raspberry's in-house IP, but it's still called properly 
Broadcom. The only difference is that Raspberry does not want its name 
on the chip, but Google does, despite it being just as custom as the 
Raspberry SoC is. The company's policy should not be a factor for this 
decision, in my opinion.

However as you've added, gs101 is the same thing as Exynos9845, so I 
believe there's no question that the Exynos name should be specified 
somewhere too, because this is what's literally wired in hardware, and 
not just a "well-known name that is used by Google in the Pixel factory 
kernel".

I agree though that just specifying the internal E9845 name could 
mislead some people, but GS101 is a similarly obscure name, and not even 
the real name of the hardware.
