A quick question: Do you imply Exynos9845 exists outside of the context 
of Tensor G1? I used to believe Exynos9845 **is** Tensor G1.

Also, what kind of Google IP are you talking about? I believe only the 
neural accelerator should be custom-ish.

Additionally, I believe it having or not having Google IP is irrelevant: 
for example, the new Raspberry Pi 5 Broadcom SoC has a lot of 
Raspberry's own IP, but it's still called Broadcom as it's the real 
manufacturer and designer of the chip.

I did not know Exynos 850 is also not going under it's real name. 
Ultimately, I believe all of those SoCs should go under their technical 
name in the exynos/ directory.

Another concern is that Google could in the future license other SoC: be 
it Qualcomm, Nvidia or anything. If we put completely different hw under 
google/ directory, does it really make sense? In that case, who'll 
maintain the google/ directory? Exynos people? Qualcomm people if they 
license it? Some other people?

Then, I don't think Tensor G3 has a proper "GS" name, it goes by "Zuma" 
in decompiled kernel modules as far as I see.

Finally, Tesla people already tried to submit drivers called by Tesla 
name, but which basically copied the functionality of the Exynos 
drivers. We would want to avoid that, ideally.

My opinion is that all the Tesla and Google SoCs should be in the 
exynos/ directory, not only because they are basically Samsung Exynos, 
but also because they don't really need a separate directory: neither 
Google nor Tesla didn't neither manufacture or design those SoCs from 
scratch. The only reason I can think of for them to have it in a 
separate directory is maybe because Google and Tesla actually paid 
Samsung money for the right to call Exynos "Google designed" SoCs, but I 
believe the kernel should be left out of that.
