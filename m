Likewise, AFAICT we added the binding but never the driver.

Looking at the git history, that schema was introduced in commit:

  50e02e9a030a9ae3 ("dt-bindings: timer: arm,twd: Convert to json-schema")

... and replaced Documentation/devicetree/bindings/timer/arm,twd.txt

Per:

  $ git log --follow Documentation/devicetree/bindings/timer/arm,twd.txt

That was introduced alongside a driver in commit:

  d8e0364364d333fe ("ARM: smp_twd: add device tree support")

... which only introduced a driver for the timer, and not the watchdog,
as the commit message notes.

Thanks.
Mark.
