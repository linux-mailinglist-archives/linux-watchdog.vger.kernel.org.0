Then why do you have to manually call devm_free_irq() in release
callbacks?  I thought that was the primary problem with those things.

I can understand devm_ calls handling resources, but callbacks and
workqueues feels like a big stretch.

How are we now going to audit the order of these calls to ensure that
this is done correctly?  That still feels like it is ripe for bugs in a
much easier way than without these functions.

I still think it is :)

Fixing bugs is good, but the abstraction away from resource management
that the devm_ calls cause is worrying as the "magic" behind them can be
wrong, as seen here.
