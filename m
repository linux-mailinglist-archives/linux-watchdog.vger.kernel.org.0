You missing the point. The oom killer is a example of a work that it can do.
it is one policy. The idea is that you should have a policy that fits your needs.

oom_score_adj is suitable for a android world. But it might be based on
uid's if your priority is some users over other.Â  Or a memcg. Or as
Christophe Leroy want the current. The policy is only a example that
fits a one area. You need to describe your prioritization, in android it is
oom_score_adj. For example I would very much have a policy that sends
sigterm instead of sigkill. But the integration with oom is there because
it is needed. Maybe a bad choice for political reasons but I don't it a
good idea to hide the intention. Please don't focus on the oom part.
