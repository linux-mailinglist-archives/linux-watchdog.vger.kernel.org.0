Yes, that's the correct thing to do.

The question is whether you'd need sub nodes for the other functions. 
Folks tend to want to have sub nodes for convenience which isn't really 
needed and then requires a DT update ('cause they add nodes as adding 
drivers).

Based on the registers, you really don't need sub nodes here.
