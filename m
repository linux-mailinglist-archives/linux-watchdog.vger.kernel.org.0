Humm.. To me it appears the intent is to adjust when the input 32KHz 
clock is slower? when it is slower we reduce the pulse count by 10% 
(assuming the crystals are with 10% off clock) so that the desired 
timeout is achieved with lesser pulse count?

Yes, i see that we need similar adjustment in u-boot as well.
