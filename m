Normally I would reject this because it is not only unnecessary and
unrelated to the problem at hand (remember: one logical change per patch),
but it is hidden in an unrelated patch, it will only make life harder
later on if/when full milli-second timeouts are introduced, and it may
result in unexpected limitations on the maximum timeout. However, Mike
accepted it, so who am I to complain.

Variable names are hardly ever perfect. I resist renaming variables
to avoid rename wars. Feel free to submit patches to improve the
documentation if you like.

Code is hardly ever perfect. Feel free to submit patches to help
improve understanding if you like.

There are watchdogs with very low maximum timeout values, sometimes less than
3 seconds. gpio-wdt is one example - some have a maximum value of 2.5 seconds.
rzn1_wd is even more extreme with a maximum of 1 second. With such low values,
accuracy is important, second-based limits are insufficient, and there is an
actual need for software timeout handling on top of hardware.

At the same time, there is actually a need to make timeouts milli-second based
instead of second-based, for uses such as medical devices where timeouts need
to be short and accurate. The only reason for not implementing this is that
the proposals I have seen so far (including mine) were too messy for my liking,
and I never had the time to clean it up. Reverting milli-second support would
be the completely wrong direction.

As mentioned before, code is hardly ever perfect. Patches to improve the
situation are welcome.
